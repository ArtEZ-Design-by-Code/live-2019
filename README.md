Semester 2

## Assignment

In this assignment, you will work towards a live audio-visual performance. Code can have a performative aspect to it: by tweaking parameters of your design in real-time, a story can be told. We will discuss different types of audio-visual performances and how they came about. In a series of workshops, we will discuss different techniques, such as creating animations and using MIDI-controllers to change different aspects of a design in real-time. Using these techniques, you will start by sketching different ideas.

Halfway through the assignment, a concept should have emerged and you will pick the music to go with your visuals. The rest of the assignment consists of shaping your ideas and sketches into one coherent program, rehearsals for your performance and the eventual performance itself.


## Goals

- Learning about dynamics and animation in code
- Understanding the concept of parameterisation
- Iterating on ideas, sketches and designs
- Live presentation of a computer program that produces visual output
- Going through an entire design process from concept to performance


## Roadmap

The assignment is split into two parts: the first part consists of workshops and a sketching phase (the divergent phase), the second consists of working towards the performance itself (the convergent phase). You will be challenged to use the programming languages you see fit and create your own time plan.

## Criteria

- How well articulated are your aesthetics?
- How does your performance give shape to your concept?
- Does your performance have a quality that it would not have had you just rendered a video and presented it?
- How did you cope with getting stuck during the design process?
- How much breadth does your collection of ideas and sketches have?
